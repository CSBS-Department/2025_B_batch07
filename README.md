The ever-growing demand for intelligent traffic management, security
surveillance, and access control systems has fueled advancements in Automatic
Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology. ANPR plays a vital role in
these domains, enabling real-time identification and tracking of vehicles through
their license plates. This technology can be used for traffic enforcement,
congestion management, security applications like tracking stolen vehicles, and
access control automation. To address this need, "License Scan" is introduced, an
efficient ANPR system that leverages a custom-trained YOLOv8 deep learning
model for object detection. License Scan tackles real-time license plate
information extraction from images or video streams. This model will be
specifically trained on a curated dataset of license plates, potentially tailored to
the region of operation for optimal performance in handling variations in plate
formats, fonts, and lighting conditions. Beyond its core functionality, License
Scan has the potential to be integrated with other intelligent transportation
systems (ITS) for even greater efficiency. Imagine a future where ANPR data is
used to dynamically adjust traffic light timings or provide real- time information
on stolen vehicles to patrol cars. The possibilities for improved traffic flow,
security, and public safety are immense. The following sections will explore the
development process in detail, including data preparation, model training and
integration, and a comprehensive evaluation of the system's effectiveness. We
will also discuss potential areas for optimization and future enhancements, aiming
to establish License Scan as a robust, practical, and scalable ANPR solution that
paves the way for a smarter and safer transportation network.
